* Create the layout for the design above using Bootstrap or to do something more customized of your own.
* Incorporate text boxes for capturing user input. Then research how to retrieve the input values in JavaScript.
* Use the [New York Times API](https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/articlesearch-product/1/overview).
* Create basic click events. Register the "Submit" button.
* Create working transfers of data between the text boxes and the back end.
* Experiment with creating content regions for where the article will go.
* Create the AJAX call needed to retrieve data, then console.log all of the relevant fields.
* Take note of various “bugs” that appear with certain searches.
* Display the HTML content!
* Continue polishing the display of content in the HTML.
* Consider adding styling or other jQuery tricks.
* Consider using Bootswatch and/or Font Awesome to add more visual appeal.
* Put in a hard effort to deal with bugs. How can you handle missing fields?

The page in this repo is the result.
